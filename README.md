# Notes #
I hate having to say this, but from my testing, if you are not running the game in Webvium... you're gonna have a bad time. It works in other browsers, but the frame rate is just not high enough. I didn't want to sacrifice any visuals for this one. Early on, I decided I would rather have it look and play better in one browser than look ok and play ok in many browsers. It is just the state of the games in browsers at the moment and I am ok with that.
